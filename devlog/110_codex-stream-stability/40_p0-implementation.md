# 110.40 — P0 Implementation: Stream Lifecycle Fixes

Implements the P0 items from `30_patch-direction.md`. P1a (heartbeat) and P2 are deferred
with rationale below. Scope kept to changes verifiable without a live Codex session.

## What shipped

### P0a — RC1: guaranteed terminal `response.completed` (`src/bridge.ts`)

Commit `1528114`. `bridgeToResponsesSSE` now tracks a `terminated` flag set on the
`done`/`error`/`catch` terminals. If the adapter generator returns **without** a terminal
event (e.g. `anthropic.ts` reaching EOF after `message_stop`, `:274-276`), the bridge closes
any open items and synthesizes a `response.completed` before `emitDone()`/`close()`. This
removes the path to the Codex parser's `"stream closed before response.completed"` →
`ApiError::Stream` (`responses.rs:457-460`).

Enforced at the **bridge** (not per-adapter) because the invariant is "the bridge always
emits exactly one terminal Responses event," independent of any adapter's quirks
(`10_root-cause-analysis.md` §2). All bridge callers inherit it, including
`web-search/loop.ts:186`.

### P0b — RC2: no-throw emit + upstream abort on disconnect (`src/bridge.ts`, `src/server.ts`)

Commits `1528114` (bridge) + `e2ae0b8` (server).

- `emit`/`emitDone` are now wrapped: a `closed` flag short-circuits and a `try/catch` swallows
  enqueue-after-teardown, killing the double-throw that previously fired inside `start()` when
  the client vanished mid-stream.
- The bridge `ReadableStream` gained a `cancel()` that sets `closed` and calls an `onCancel`
  hook.
- `handleResponses` (`server.ts`) creates an `AbortController`, passes `signal` to the routed
  upstream `fetch`, and passes `() => upstream.abort()` as the bridge's `onCancel`. A client
  disconnect now aborts the upstream instead of leaking the connection / draining tokens.

## RC status after P0

| ID | Cause | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| RC1 | Missing terminal `response.completed` (bridge) | **Fixed** (`1528114`) + unit-tested |
| RC2 | Double-throw on disconnect | **Fixed** (`1528114`) |
| RC2 | Upstream not aborted on disconnect (bridge path) | **Fixed** (`e2ae0b8`); passthrough path deferred |
| RC3 | No idle heartbeat | **Deferred** (needs production `idle_timeout` value) |
| RC4 | Bridge error envelope | Fixed in 100.5 (`a0d4ec9`); `rate_limit_exceeded` note stands |
| RC5 | Passthrough header fidelity | Mitigated in 100.5; regression already covered by `tests/error-fidelity.test.ts` |

## Verification

- New `tests/bridge-lifecycle.test.ts` (4 tests): terminal guarantee for a no-`done` stream,
  single `response.completed` on normal `done` (no double terminal), `response.failed` with no
  synthetic completed on `error`, and `cancel()` firing the `onCancel`/abort hook.
- `bun test` → **30 pass / 0 fail** (was 26; +4). `bun x tsc --noEmit` clean.

## Deferred (and why)

- **RC3 idle keep-alive.** Investigated: `idle_timeout` is `DEFAULT_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS =
  300_000` by default but as low as `5_000` / `9_000` for some provider configs
  (`model-provider-info/src/lib.rs:26`, `model-provider/src/provider.rs:366`,
  `config/src/thread_config/remote.rs:472`). Critically, a plain SSE **comment does NOT reset**
  Codex's event-level `timeout(idle_timeout, stream.next())` (`responses.rs:446`,
  `eventsource_stream`) — the keep-alive must be a real, parser-ignored event
  (`response.heartbeat`), not a comment. Deferred pending the user's provider `idle_timeout`
  and maintainer sign-off on the new wire event (`30_patch-direction.md` §P1a, revised).
- **RC2 passthrough abort.** The passthrough path returns `upstreamResponse.body` directly;
  whether client-cancel propagates to abort the upstream depends on Bun's stream/fetch
  behavior — needs a live check before wiring (avoid breaking high-fidelity passthrough).
- **P2** (rate-limit code mapping, dropped-frame logging) — opportunistic; current behavior
  is acceptable.

## Remaining acceptance gate

The symptom is only fully reproducible with a live Codex CLI pointed at `ocx` using a routed
model over a multi-turn session that includes interrupts. Unit + regression tests prove the
mechanism-level fixes; the end-to-end confirmation (no `ApiError::Stream`, no leaked upstream
connections) is owed in the user's environment.
