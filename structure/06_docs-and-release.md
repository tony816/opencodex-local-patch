# Docs And Release SOT

## Public docs

The public documentation site lives in `docs-site/` and is built with Astro + Starlight. English is
served at the site root, Korean under `/ko`, and Simplified Chinese under `/zh-cn`.

Manual navigation is defined in `docs-site/astro.config.mjs`. When adding a public page, update the
sidebar and either add localized copies or intentionally accept Starlight fallback behavior.

## GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` publishes the docs to:

```text
https://lidge-jun.github.io/opencodex/
```

The workflow runs on `main` pushes touching `docs-site/**` or the workflow itself, builds
`docs-site`, uploads the artifact, and deploys with GitHub Pages.

Local validation:

```bash
cd docs-site
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
```

## GitHub workflow map

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | `pull_request`, `push` to `main`/`dev`/`preview`, or manual dispatch when runtime/package paths change | Short Linux + Windows quality gate. `test` job (Bun) runs typecheck/tests/GUI build; `npm-global-smoke` job (Node only, **no setup-bun**) packs and `npm install -g`s the tarball, then runs `ocx help` to prove the bundled-Bun launcher works without a separate Bun install. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Manual dispatch only | npm publish/dry-run workflow. It requires the exact `GITHUB_SHA` to have a successful Cross-platform CI run before publish or dry-run. |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` | `push` to `main` touching `docs-site/**` or the workflow, or manual dispatch | Build and publish the Astro/Starlight docs site to GitHub Pages. |
| `.github/workflows/service-lifecycle.yml` | `push` touching `src/service.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, or the workflow, or manual dispatch | Linux systemd smoke test: install, verify, `ocx stop` stops the service, uninstall. |

Docs-only changes intentionally route through the docs workflow instead of the runtime CI gate. If a
docs change also edits runtime/package/release files, run the relevant local runtime checks before
push and let `ci.yml` provide the Linux/Windows confirmation. Service-related changes
(`src/service.ts`, `src/cli.ts`) additionally trigger the `service-lifecycle.yml` smoke test on Linux.

## Root README

The root READMEs are the concise product entrypoint. They should explain what opencodex does, how to
install/start it, where Codex state is touched, and where the full docs live. Deep implementation
invariants belong in `structure/`, not the README.

## Historical docs

`docs/` contains investigations and diagnostic notes. Do not treat it as the current public user
manual. When an investigation graduates into a maintained invariant, summarize it here under
`structure/` and link public workflows from `docs-site/`.

## Package runtime (bundled Bun)

The source runs on Bun, but the published package does **not** require a user-installed Bun.
`package.json` `bin` points at `bin/ocx.mjs` (a Node shim), and the Bun runtime ships as the `bun`
npm dependency (esbuild-style: a tiny main package plus platform-specific `@oven/bun-*`
`optionalDependencies`, finalized by the dependency's own `postinstall: node install.js`).

Invariants:

- `bin/ocx.mjs` resolves the bundled binary via `require.resolve("bun/package.json")` and a size gate
  (`>= 1 MB`) that rejects the ~450-byte placeholder stub left by `--ignore-scripts`/pnpm; it then
  lazy-runs `install.js` and execs `src/cli.ts` under Bun, propagating exit code and signal.
- `package.json` carries `"trustedDependencies": ["bun"]` so `bun install` runs the dependency's
  postinstall, and `"engines": { "node": ">=18" }` (Bun is no longer a user prerequisite).
- `src/service.ts` and `src/codex-shim.ts` bake `durableBunPath()` (the bundled binary, stable under
  the npm global prefix) into launchd/systemd/Task Scheduler and the Codex autostart shim, so those
  durable artifacts keep resolving across `ocx update`.
- Public docs (root READMEs + `docs-site` installation pages, all locales) state Node 18+ as the only
  prerequisite. Do not reintroduce "install Bun first" / "bun must be on PATH" guidance for npm users.

## Release workflow

Package release is npm-focused. `package.json` exposes `opencodex` and `ocx`, `prepublishOnly` runs
typecheck and GUI build, and `scripts/release.ts` handles version bump, commit/push, waiting for
Cross-platform CI, and dispatching the GitHub Release workflow. Docs publishing is separate from npm
release publishing.

## Release metadata invariants

Every npm release version must map cleanly across four surfaces:

| Surface | Required state |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` | `version` equals the release workflow `version` input. |
| npm registry | `@bitkyc08/opencodex@<version>` does not exist before publish, then exists after publish with the requested dist-tag. |
| Git tag | `v<version>` does not exist before publish, then points at the exact release commit. |
| GitHub Release | `v<version>` does not exist before publish, then is created from the exact release commit. |

The release must fail before `npm publish` if npm, the Git tag, or the GitHub Release already has the
requested version. This prevents partial releases where npm is published but GitHub Release creation
fails afterward.

Do not force-move public version tags by default. If release metadata is already inconsistent, treat
the version as consumed and publish the next unused patch version instead. Only rewrite a public tag
after an explicit human decision that the public history rewrite is acceptable.

Manual preflight checks when debugging a release:

```bash
npm view @bitkyc08/opencodex@<version> version
git ls-remote origin refs/tags/v<version>
gh release view v<version>
```

If any of these commands reports an existing artifact for the requested version, stop before
publishing. For a non-destructive recovery, choose the next unused patch version and release that
version through `scripts/release.ts`.

## Cross-platform CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the ordinary quality gate for runtime/package changes. It runs on
Linux and Windows only, using the intentionally short command set:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun x tsc --noEmit
bun test tests
bun build scripts/release.ts --target=bun --outdir=.tmp/ci-release-script-check
bun run src/cli.ts help
```

The CI intentionally does not build docs, build the GUI, run coverage, run macOS, or perform remote
Ubuntu/RDP smoke tests. Those stay outside the default gate until a concrete regression justifies the
extra runtime.

The Release workflow remains manual and publish-focused. Before any dry-run or publish step, it
checks that the exact release commit (`GITHUB_SHA`) already has a successful Cross-platform CI run.
This keeps release runs short and makes release a deployment of a verified commit rather than a
second CI pipeline.
