</p>

Use Claude, Gemini, Grok, GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, Ollama, or any other LLM with Codex — without waiting for OpenAI to add support.

opencodex is a lightweight local proxy that translates Codex's Responses API into whatever your provider speaks. Streaming, tool calls, reasoning tokens, images — everything works, in both directions.

```
Codex CLI / App / SDK ──/v1/responses──▶ opencodex ──▶ Any provider
                                              │
              Anthropic · Google · xAI · Kimi · Ollama Cloud · Groq
              OpenRouter · Azure · DeepSeek · GLM · …and OpenAI itself
```

## Supported platforms

| OS | Status | Service manager |
|---|---|---|
| macOS (arm64 / x64) | Fully supported | launchd |
| Linux (x64 / arm64) | Fully supported | systemd (user unit) |
| Windows (x64) | Fully supported | Task Scheduler |

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.1+. All three platforms work natively (no WSL needed on Windows).

## Quick start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @bitkyc08/opencodex      # or: bun install -g @bitkyc08/opencodex

# Interactive setup (writes config, injects into Codex, and offers autostart shim install)
ocx init

# Start the proxy
ocx start

# If you skipped it during init, install the on-demand autostart shim later
ocx codex-shim install

# Use Codex normally — it now routes through opencodex
codex "Write a hello world in Rust"
```

<details>
<summary><b>Don't have <a href="https://bun.sh">bun</a>?</b> — install it first (opencodex runs on bun)</summary>

<br/>

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then re-run `npm install -g @bitkyc08/opencodex`. (The `ocx` binary is bun-native, so bun must be on your `PATH`.)

</details>

## Add a provider

The fastest way to add a provider is through the web dashboard:

```bash
ocx gui
```

This opens the dashboard at `http://localhost:10100`. From there:

1. Click **"Add Provider"**
2. Pick from **40+ built-in providers** — or enter a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
3. Paste your API key (or log in via OAuth for Anthropic, xAI, and Kimi)
4. Models are **auto-discovered** from the provider's `/v1/models` endpoint

Your new provider is ready to use immediately. No restart needed.

You can also add providers through `ocx init` (interactive CLI) or by editing `~/.opencodex/config.json` directly.

## Model routing

Target any configured provider and model using the `provider/model` syntax:

```bash
# Use Claude Opus through Anthropic
codex -m "anthropic/claude-opus-4-8" "Explain this stack trace"

# Use Gemini through Google
codex -m "google/gemini-3-pro" "Write unit tests for auth.ts"

# Use GLM through Ollama Cloud
codex -m "ollama-cloud/glm-5.2" "Write a SQL migration"

# Use a local model through Ollama
codex -m "ollama/llama3" "Refactor this function"
```

When you omit the `provider/` prefix, opencodex routes to the default provider — or auto-matches based on the model name pattern (e.g., `claude-*` routes to Anthropic, `gpt-*` routes to OpenAI).

Routed models also appear in the **Codex App** model picker with per-model reasoning effort controls:

</p>

## Highlights

- **Use any LLM with Codex.** 5 protocol adapters cover Anthropic Messages, Google Gemini, Azure, OpenAI Responses passthrough, and every OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint — that's 40+ providers out of the box.
- **Log in once, skip the API key.** OAuth support for xAI, Anthropic, and Kimi means you can authenticate with your existing account. Tokens auto-refresh. Or forward your `codex login`, paste an API key, or use `${ENV_VAR}` references — your call.
- **Works everywhere Codex does.** Injects into Codex CLI, TUI, App, and SDK automatically. Routed models show up in Codex's model picker just like native ones.
- **Delegate to the right model.** Feature up to five routed or native models in Codex's subagent picker from the dashboard or config — route complex tasks to a reasoning model, fast tasks to a cheap one.
- **Give any model superpowers.** Non-OpenAI models get real web search and image understanding via a `gpt-5.4-mini` sidecar over your ChatGPT login.
- **See what's happening.** The web dashboard shows providers, OAuth status, model selection, and a live request log — no more guessing why a request failed.
- **Runs in the background.** Install as a system service (launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler) and forget about it. The proxy starts on boot and stays out of your way.
- **Clean exit, zero residue.** `ocx stop` (or the dashboard's Stop button) shuts down the proxy, stops the background service if one is installed, and restores Codex to its original configuration. Plain `codex` works exactly as it did before — no leftover config, no orphaned processes.

## Providers & adapters

| Provider | Adapter | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI (ChatGPT login) | `openai-responses` | forward (no key) |
| OpenAI (API key) | `openai-responses` | key |
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | oauth / key |
| xAI Grok | `openai-chat` | oauth / key |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | `openai-chat` | oauth / key |
| Google Gemini | `google` | key |
| Azure OpenAI | `azure-openai` | key |
| Ollama Cloud + 17-provider catalog | `openai-chat` | key |
| Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio (local) | `openai-chat` | key (usually blank) |
| Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | `openai-chat` | key |

Plus DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, Fireworks, Cerebras, Mistral, Hugging Face, NVIDIA NIM, MiniMax, Qwen Portal, and more. See the full list with `ocx init` or in the [provider docs](https://lidge-jun.github.io/opencodex/reference/configuration/).

## CLI

```bash
ocx init                       # interactive setup
ocx start [--port 10100]       # start the proxy; falls back to a free port if busy
ocx stop                       # stop + restore native Codex
ocx restore                    # restore without stopping (alias: ocx eject)
ocx uninstall                  # remove service/shim/config and restore native Codex
ocx ensure                     # start if needed + refresh Codex config/cache
ocx sync                       # refresh models + re-inject into Codex
ocx codex-shim install         # run `ocx ensure` whenever `codex` is launched
ocx status                     # is the proxy running?
ocx login <xai|anthropic|kimi> # OAuth login
ocx logout <provider>          # remove a stored login
ocx gui                        # open the web dashboard
ocx service <install|start|stop|status|uninstall>   # background service (launchd/systemd/schtasks)
ocx update                     # update opencodex to the latest published version
```

### Autostart: service vs shim

opencodex has two ways to auto-start the proxy:

| | `ocx service install` | `ocx codex-shim install` |
|---|---|---|
| **How** | OS service manager (launchd / systemd / schtasks) | Replaces the `codex` binary with a wrapper script |
| **When** | Always running after login | On-demand — runs `ocx ensure` when `codex` is launched |
| **Restart** | Auto-restarts on crash | Starts once per `codex` invocation |
| **Codex updates** | Unaffected | Repairs on next `ocx codex-shim install` or `ocx update` |
| **Remove** | `ocx service uninstall` | `ocx codex-shim uninstall` |

Use the **service** for always-on proxy (recommended for development machines). Use the **shim** for
lightweight, on-demand proxy startup without a background daemon. Shim autostart is enabled by default
and can be disabled from the GUI dashboard. If the configured proxy port is already busy, `ocx start`
automatically picks another free local port and updates Codex to use it.

### Uninstall

Before removing the npm/bun package, clean up local state:

```bash
ocx uninstall
npm uninstall -g @bitkyc08/opencodex   # or: bun remove -g @bitkyc08/opencodex
```

`ocx uninstall` stops the proxy, removes any installed service, removes the Codex shim, restores
native Codex config/catalog/history, and deletes `~/.opencodex`.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.opencodex/config.json`. Here's a typical multi-provider setup:

```json
{
  "port": 10100,
  "defaultProvider": "anthropic",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "adapter": "anthropic",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com",
      "authMode": "oauth",
      "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    },
    "ollama-cloud": {
      "adapter": "openai-chat",
      "baseUrl": "https://ollama.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "${OLLAMA_API_KEY}",
      "defaultModel": "glm-5.2"
    }
  }
}
```

Local models work too. Point opencodex at any OpenAI-compatible server running on your machine:

```json
{
  "port": 10100,
  "defaultProvider": "ollama",
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "adapter": "openai-chat",
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
      "authMode": "key",
      "apiKey": "",
      "defaultModel": "llama3"
    },
    "vllm": {
      "adapter": "openai-chat",
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
      "authMode": "key",
      "apiKey": "",
      "defaultModel": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B"
    }
  }
}
```

WebSocket transport is off by default. Set `"websockets": true` only if you want Codex to advertise and use the Responses WebSocket path instead of HTTP/SSE.

opencodex leaves existing Codex resume history untouched by default. This avoids changing Codex's
local thread index just because the proxy started, but Codex App may hide old OpenAI-backed project
threads while `opencodex` is the active provider. If you want those existing chats to appear while
the proxy is active, enable the compatibility remap with `"syncResumeHistory": true`. Restore still
maps previously remapped `opencodex` rows back to `openai`.
